        <h2>Trader Joe's Order Guide ReVamp</h2>

        <p>
          While I was working at Trader Joe's in good old Goleta, half-way
          through my time there (8 years in total), the system we would place
          our orders on was updated from paper to a tablet app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The software itself was a good idea, but it was poorly optimized and
          not really suited to our needs as employees. It took me a while but
          after a few trials and a lot of feedback from my coworkers, I was able
          to run a stable alternative.

        <h2>Recipes For Life</h2>

        <p>
          During the pandemic I had a lot of time to think, and a lot of time to
          bake. Bread especially. Then started a journey of baguettes, country
          loaves and sourdough bread.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that didn't quite stop there, I needed more. I then started asking
          the people back home in my family, extended family and dearest friends
          for there favorite recipes or some of the ones they had done for me in
          my childhood, so that I could try and replicate them myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be able to share those recipes with my friends and family here in
          my new home, it gave me such joy that I decided I wanted to make them
          accessible to whoever could find them, and so I made a blog-style
          website called "Recipes For Life".
