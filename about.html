        <h2>Music Production</h2>
        <img src="images/music.jpeg" alt="Production" />
        <p>
          I have always enjoyed music, and I think it's in great part thanks to
          my father, who taught me guitar when I was around 10 years old. I then
          got my own guitar and rapidly started a punk-rock band with two of my
          best friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once in highschool I joined another more advanced and serious band,
          and polished a lot of my musical skills and tastes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the band eventually split at the end of highschool, I found an
          interest in continuing making music on my own, and this time on a
          laptop rather than in a band. Highly influenced by music discovered in
          later years amd shown to me by various friends, my style changed as
          well, focusing mainly on producing chill edm.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this day I still produce music as a hobby, very slowly, but it is a
          crucial part of my life, couldn't do without it. Check-out my

        <h2>Cooking and Baking</h2>
        <img src="images/baking.jpeg" alt="Baking" />
        <p>
          Cooking and baking have always been a big part of what brings my
          family together. My parents have always prepared home-cooked meals for
          us, and my sister got an interest in baking at a very young age. For
          me it came later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably by necessity, I started cooking more advanced dishes than
          pasta and eggs when I became an adult and lived in a relationship. The
          pleasure and satisfaction of serving a home-made meal hit me then. The
          lockdown obviously allowed me to have more time to practice recipes
          and especially baking bread, which is one of the things I miss most
          from my home country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have been replicating my family's diverse recipes when
          ever I have time or a good excuse of an occasion to just cook and
          bake.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are still so many classics of my childhood I want to replicate.
          It is actually one of my projects to make a website to be able to
          share those recipes with the rest of the world, in a detailed and easy
          to understand manner. Wether it's my italian grandma's Tiramisu or my
          brother-in-law's Gateau Basque recipe, there are so many good things I
          think are worth sharing.

        <h2>Hiking</h2>
        <img src="images/hiking.jpeg" alt="hiking" />
        <p>
          I moved to Santa Barbara about 10 years ago now (2023 now), and one of
          people's favorite activity to hear is hiking. And how could I blame
          them, the area is nothing short of breathtakingly beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the perfect outing to go on either alone or with friends, and
          there are so many trails to choose from. I is also an amazing way to
          discover the area and it's fauna and flora.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a go-to for regular physical activity or a once in a while much
          needed mental boost, as walking in nature is the perfect way to
          introspect and organize your thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I highly recommend it of you are ever lucky enough to be in these
          parts or anywhere that offers nice trails to discover!
